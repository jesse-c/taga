Title: Technology-supported activities through realtime, distributed, and collaborative interfaces

Abstract: Traditionally user interfaces have been designed for a single user using a single, expected deviceâ€”e.g. someone on a computer visiting a website. With the advent and lowering costs of the internet and mobile devices, interfaces are now often distributed and collaborative. While there have been attempts to to handle this (e.g. Google Docs), they have so far been in a limited, prescribed manner. In this proposal, a project is put forward to design and build a new approach for a distributed and collaborative user interface focusing on the concept of having a workspace with avail- able objects and data sources that the user is able to freely use. The experimental applications will be with a remote laboratory experiment and learning programming.

Prototype: Workspaces
--------

The infrastructure for specifying, creating, and using workspaces was created. This includes the necessary creation of the related workspace components such as objects and data sources.

When a workspace is chosen, a new room is created which is an instance of that workspace.

In order to demonstrate the thesis a demonstration workspace was created with the purpose being for students to collaborate together and learn about pulse width modulation and simple colour theory. The hardware component can be seen [here](https://github.com/jesse-c/thesis-sensor).
